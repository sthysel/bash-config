# bash config

Some aliases and config options I'm used to when using bash.

# Things not set here
*MACHINE_LOCATION* is set in /etc/bash.rc so all bash shells gets that. That variable
switches things on (proxy) when a VM or machine is deployed or running at work. 
Setting proxies depending on network may be better.

I only control home subnet so maybe test for that, as a generic setup should be run at work,
digital ocean or anywhere else where subnets are not known or configurable.
